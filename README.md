# keystore

While building applications and continuous delivery pipelines, secret management is usually one of the first non-trivial problems you run across. The Keystore utility pairs to AWS services to handle encryption and storage of secret data.

The Keystore stores all data in a DynamoDB table, indexed on the key's name. All data is (going to be...) encrypted using the Key Management Service. Both this services have costs associated with them, but even at moderate use will still be cheaper than running an EC2 instance with key management software on it.

# usage

## tests

You have rspec, cucumber, and rubocop installed right?

    gem install rspec cucumber rubocop
  
Okay, now from the the root of the repo you can do these things.

* To run the unit tests:

        rspec 

* To run static analysis:

        rubocop

* To run the integration tests, you'll need to set up a KMS Key manually and write down the key_id. Then, you'll need to set up a DynamoDB, but you can use the included cfn template for that.

        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOURACCESSKEY
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOURSECRETKEY
        aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name keystore-test-db --template-body file://config/dynamo.json
        echo "This takes a minute, so go get yourself a coffee." && sleep 60
        export table_name=`aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name jonny-test-ddb --query Stacks[*].Outputs[*].OutputValue --output text`
        
* Then to run the integration tests

        cucumber region="us-east-1" table_name="$table_name" key_id="your-iam-kms-key-id" 

## api

  ```keystore = Keystore.new dynamo: dynamodb_client, table_name: table_name
  keystore.store key: key, value: value```

  ```keystore = Keystore.new dynamo: dynamodb_client, table_name: table_name
  keystore.store key: key, value: value```

## cli 

tbd.  probably something like `keystore store --table table_name --key key_name --value value` and `keystore retrieve --table table_name --key key_name`
